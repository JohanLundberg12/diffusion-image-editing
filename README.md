# Image Editing Using Pretrained Generative Models

In my data science thesis project of 2023, I explored how to edit real and synthetic images using pretrained denoising diffusion models and gradient guidance. 
I investigated three different gradient guidance approaches:
1. colour guidance,
2. image-segmentation guidance
3. classifier-guidance.
   
I show the results of applying each method to the denoising process of three diffusion models:
1. DDPM
2. LDM
3. Stable Diffusion
